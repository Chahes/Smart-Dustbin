# Smart-Dustbin
This is an IOT based IT project to solve the problem of overflowing dustbin smartly. 
When the Garbage in Dustbin reaches a threshold  level, the InfraRed sensor detects it and a email is sent to the authority notifying that
the dustbin is full.
When the authority cleans the garbage, another mail is sent to the mentioned id notifying that the action has been taken properly. 

Steps:
1. Install Arduino Software.
2. Run the email_detection file in the above software
3. Run the python script "imp.py" in cmd to receive notifications.
